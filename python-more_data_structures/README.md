This repository holds all the tasks and projects for the topic of sequences and dictionaries. A dictionary is a data structure that holds a string and an integer type data, usually for information about people, like log books phone books, receiptbooks etc. These dirctionaries are arranged in keys instead of by index and are initialized with the set{} method, using curly braces instead of with parenthesis.  Sets, on the other hand, are an unordered version of a list with no duplicate. These are initialized with the set() method or with curly braces alone. Doing something like set{} wil initialize a dictionary instead of a set, so be very careful.
