THis is the beginning of our work woith data structures in python. For the time being, we will be introduced to lists, arrays and tuples: the simplest of data types. List are like arrays in C, and are a block containing multiple contents of the same data type, it can be initialized easily and elements can be appended to the array even after it has been initialized with a set amount of elements. Tuples are like arrays, butthey contain multiple data types instead of just one.
